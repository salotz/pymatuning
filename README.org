(Currently) A small module for generating todo lists in plain text
from a python module.

The motivation is that I want to do a methodical check of certain
properties for a sizable module with many submodules, classes, and
methods.

I figured this could be automated.

The name is just the first thing I thought of with 'py' in it.
